# Final Project: Text-based RPG

by Cade Haley and Mitch Block

Project Summary:
===
A text-based RPG game that relies on graphs (and possibly other data structures) to function. The program takes user input and uses it to navigate to different nodes in the graph connected by adjacent vertices, and local variables to store skill data and game progress. Using a graph-based method of assembling the game allows for a lot of flexibility in adding rooms and changing output, and even allows for potential randomly generated maps.

Dependencies:
===
The program uses all standard library c++ material (at least right now) like string, vector, and queue libraries that follow the c++11 standard.

System requirements:
===
Natively Ubuntu but able to be compiled to an executable on different operating systems, this program does not make use of any system-specific external libraries (right now at least). Most c++11 compilers will be able to compile it successfully.
