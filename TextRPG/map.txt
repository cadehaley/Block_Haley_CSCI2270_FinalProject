South gates
You are at the south gates of Nordsjaelland, looking at the vast Zeljeznicar forest.
0
You've decided to go on a quest to find and destroy an illusive creature, a spirit, which has been threatening Nordsjaelland. Villagers have told you not to approach it unless you have acquired the skills to defeat it-- however, you only have several days before they fear it will come back. It would be wise to plot your journey carefully...

# Success and failure endings

Success
Using all the might and skill you can muster, you swing your sword with the strength of 1000 axe throws, navigating your way around its every move and finally silence it with a blade slice of the utmost precision, like that of an experienced farmer. You defeat the monster!! Your initial look of terror, similar to that when leaving the necromancer's cave, is now a sweet grin of victory.

You Win. GAME OVER
